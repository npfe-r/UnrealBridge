# UnrealBridge

Execute Python directly inside a running UE 5.4+ editor. Auto-discovers via UDP multicast (`239.255.42.99:9876`); the TCP data port is OS-assigned per editor.

## Preconditions

If `bridge.py` returns `discovery: no UnrealBridge editors found`, walk these in order — don't troubleshoot Python or firewalls first:

1. **Plugin installed** in `<UEProject>/Plugins/UnrealBridge/` (use `sync_plugin.bat` from this repo; user must edit its `DST=` once). Check: `<UEProject>/Plugins/UnrealBridge/UnrealBridge.uplugin` exists.
2. **Plugin enabled** — check `<UEProject>/<Project>.uproject` `"Plugins"` block for `{"Name":"UnrealBridge", "Enabled":false}` and flip if present.
3. **Editor up and ready** — `bridge.py ping` returns `"ready": true`. `false` means MainFrame still loading; wait 10–60s.

Last resort if multicast is blocked (corp VPN, virtual NIC): `--endpoint=127.0.0.1:<port>` from the editor log line `LogUnrealBridge: Listening on 127.0.0.1:<port>`. Python 3.7+ stdlib only.

## Bridge CLI

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/bridge.py" [options] <command> [args]
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ping` | Check UE connection (TCP-only, doesn't touch GameThread) |
| `exec "<code>"` | Execute single inline statement |
| `exec --stdin <<'EOF' ... EOF` | Multi-line script from stdin (default for >1 line; `-` is shorthand for `--stdin`) |
| `exec-file <path>` | Execute a .py file (use when iterating, debugging, or keeping the script) |
| `preflight <path>` | Lint a script for bridge-call errors WITHOUT sending to UE |
| `suggest [pattern]` | Look up the bridge equivalent for a raw `unreal.*` fallback |
| `gamethread-ping` | Probe GameThread liveness (bypasses exec queue; use when `exec` hangs) |
| `resume` | Unstick a paused BP breakpoint |
| `list-editors` | Print every editor that responded to a discovery probe |
| `wait-compile <material>` / `wait-pose-index <psd>` | Client-side polling helpers |

Optional flags: `--project=<name|path>` (disambiguate when >1 editors run; or env `UNREAL_BRIDGE_PROJECT`), `--endpoint=host:port`, `--token=<secret>`, `--timeout=<s>`, `--json`, `--no-preflight`.

## Workflow

1. **Always ping first.**
2. Pick the execution mode by shape (table above): `exec` for one-liners, `exec --stdin` for multi-line one-shots (the **80% case**), `exec-file` only when you'll iterate / keep.
3. `--json` for parseable output.
4. Exit codes: `0` success · `1` runtime/transport · `2` bad CLI args · `3` AST preflight rejected.
5. **If `exec` hangs**: from a separate terminal try `gamethread-ping` (high latency = GT mid-exec, queue will drain) or `resume` (BP breakpoint).

Multi-line example:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/bridge.py" exec --stdin <<'EOF'
from unreal_bridge import Asset
paths, _ = Asset.search_assets_in_all_content(query="Hero", max_results=5)
for p in paths:
    print(p.export_text())
EOF
```

## API surface — use the wrapper module first

```python
from unreal_bridge import Asset, Level, Blueprint, Editor, Anim, Material, PoseSearch, Chooser, ...
paths, _ = Asset.search_assets_in_all_content(query="Hero", max_results=20)
```

The wrapper has 16 classes (one per `UnrealBridge*Library`) with **kwargs-only signatures** — positional args raise `TypeError` immediately, no UE round-trip. This is the structural fix for positional-arg-order hallucinations. Regenerate after C++ header changes via `python tools/gen_manifest.py`.

Fallback: raw `unreal.UnrealBridge*Library.foo(...)` works (preflight catches errors), but prefer the wrapper.

## AST preflight (automatic)

Every `exec*` call runs an AST preflight in the bridge client BEFORE sending. Reads `scripts/bridge_manifest.json` and rejects locally (exit 3, no UE round-trip) when:

- Function/library name doesn't exist (with did-you-mean)
- Required args missing / unknown kwarg / param given twice
- `unreal.BridgeXxx.YYY` enum member doesn't exist

Type validation is NOT done by preflight. Wrong asset paths / wrong scope still surface at runtime — references prose still matters for those.

Bypass with `--no-preflight` (rare). Preview with `bridge.py preflight <path>`.

## Common semantic traps (preflight does NOT catch)

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Bridge call returns `[]` for an asset you know exists | Wrong scope: `PROJECT` covers `/Game` only; plugin assets need `ALL_ASSETS`. Use `Asset.search_assets_in_all_content(...)`. |
| `get_derived_classes` hangs / huge results | Don't pass `UObject` / `AActor` — narrow to most specific base. |
| Multi-step BP edit feels chatty | Batch with `exec --stdin` heredoc or `exec-file`, not 3 inline `exec` calls. |
| Pawn movement script freezes the editor | `time.sleep` inside `exec` blocks GameThread — see `bridge-gameplay-api.md` "chase a target" pattern (use `register_runtime_timer`). |
| `print('中文' / '한글' / '日本語')` shows `���` or `涓枃` mojibake | Almost always **display-only** — the wire is byte-perfect UTF-8. See "Non-ASCII output (CJK / Greek / emoji)" below. |
| Need "where is this GameplayTag used?" / Find References on a tag | `unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayTagLibrary.find_assets_referencing_tag(tag, include_children, ...)`. For `PrimaryAssetId` / other named-value structs use the generic `UnrealBridgeAssetLibrary.find_assets_referencing_searchable_name(struct_type, value, ...)`. See `bridge-gameplaytag-api.md`. |

## Reading UE object attributes — never `<obj>.<attr>`

Guessing attribute names on a UE object reference is the **#1 remaining hallucination source**. The bridge has a generic property pipeline:

```python
from unreal_bridge import Level
props = Level.list_actor_properties(actor_name='/Persistent/MyActor')
# OR before spawning:
props = Level.list_class_properties(class_path='/Script/Engine.SkyAtmosphere')
# Read by name (dotted paths supported):
loc = Level.get_actor_property(actor_name='/Persistent/MyActor',
                               property_path='RootComponent.RelativeLocation')
```

If you find yourself typing `<some_var>.attribute_name` on a UE object — **stop**, list properties first.

## Never silently bail to raw `unreal.*`

If a bridge call returns empty / errors, suspect **your parameters** (wrong scope / path / filter), not the wrapper. Falling back to `unreal.AssetRegistryHelpers` etc. bypasses preflight, audit logging, and often walks 100k–2M registry entries.

Preflight emits `[WARN]` on known raw-fallback patterns and shows the bridge equivalent inline. To look up before writing: `bridge.py suggest [pattern]`. Patterns currently mapped:

| Raw pattern | Bridge equivalent |
|---|---|
| `ar.get_assets_by_path(...)` | `Asset.list_assets_under_path(folder_path, include_subfolders)` |
| `ar.get_referencers(...)` | `Asset.get_package_referencers(package_name, hard_only)` |
| `ar.get_dependencies(...)` | `Asset.get_package_dependencies(package_name, hard_only)` |
| `unreal.GameplayStatics.get_all_actors_of_class(...)` | `Level.find_actors_by_class(class_path, max_results)` |
| `unreal.GameplayStatics.get_all_actors_with_tag(...)` | `Level.find_actors_by_tag(tag)` |

If you genuinely believe no bridge function covers your case, **ask the user before reaching for raw `unreal.*`**.

## Reference index — read these for usage / traps / workflow patterns

Signatures are now mechanically enforced (preflight). References carry semantic traps, scope warnings, and workflow patterns preflight can't catch.

| Topic | File | When to read |
|-------|------|------|
| Blueprint queries + authoring | `references/bridge-blueprint-api.md` | Class hierarchy, variables/functions/components, node search, write ops, auto-layout flow, lint loop |

| Editor session | `references/bridge-editor-api.md` | Asset open/save, viewport camera, PIE start/stop, console/CVars, BP compile |
| GameplayAbility | `references/bridge-gameplayability-api.md` | GA Blueprint metadata |
| **GameplayTag references / sources** | `references/bridge-gameplaytag-api.md` | "Where is this tag used / defined?" — `find_assets_referencing_tag` (with child-tag expansion), `list_all_registered_tags`, `get_tag_source_info`. **Read-only — no `rename_*` / `add_*` / `remove_*` UFUNCTIONs exist; for those see the "Not in this library" section of the doc.** Built on the AssetRegistry SearchableName index — `bridge-asset-api.md` "SearchableName Index" has the generic version (PrimaryAssetId, custom named-value structs). |
| **Motion Matching — PoseSearch** | `references/bridge-pose-search-api.md` | **Read before any PSS / PSD read or write** — `DatabaseAnimationAssets` / `Channels` are `private:` and unreachable via `get_editor_property`; this lib is the only path. Includes `wait-pose-index` CLI. |
| **Motion Matching — Chooser** | `references/bridge-chooser-api.md` | **Read before any CHT read or write** — `ResultsStructs` / `DisabledRows` etc. are `private:`; this lib is the only path. Covers NestedChooser `:Name` paths, `matched_row=-1` caveat, and the auto Compile+PostEditChange contract. |
| Reactive handlers | `references/bridge-reactive.md` | Register Python on UE events (GameplayEvent / AnimNotify / MovementMode / Attribute / ActorLifecycle / InputAction). |
| Navigation | `references/bridge-navigation-api.md` | NavMesh OBJ export |
| Perf snapshots | `references/bridge-perf-api.md` | Structured FPS / GT / RT / GPU / draw calls / mem / UObject histogram |
| Agent / Gameplay | `references/bridge-gameplay-api.md` | **Mandatory before driving the player pawn** — sticky inputs, camera steering, navmesh path planning. |
| UE Asset / Actor / Material | `references/ue-python-*.md` | Stdlib UE Python helpers (load, list, duplicate, spawn) |

> **Pawn control is non-obvious — read `bridge-gameplay-api.md` first.** Driving the player (sticky `IA_Move`, `apply_look_input`, navigating to a moving target, holding an input over time) has hard constraints a fresh API read won't reveal: `bridge.exec` runs on GameThread so `time.sleep` inside one `exec` freezes the engine and stops the sticky ticker; continuous steering must run from a reactive `register_runtime_timer` callback, not a Python `while` loop; `IA_Move` is camera-relative and the forward-axis convention varies per project. The "Pattern: chase a (possibly moving) target and stop on arrival" section has the working template.

> **Asset lookup by name defaults to `search_assets_in_all_content(name, max_results)`.** When the user names an asset without a path, do **not** call `unreal.AssetRegistryHelpers.get_assets_by_path('/Game', recursive=True)` and filter — that walks 100k–2M+ entries and times out. The full `search_assets` form needs `BridgeAssetSearchScope.ALL_ASSETS` (not `PROJECT`) when the asset might live in a plugin mount (`/PluginName/...`). `PROJECT` covers `/Game` only; using it for a plugin asset returns `[]` silently. Valid scope members: `ALL_ASSETS`, `PROJECT`, `CUSTOM_PACKAGE_PATH` — there is no `GAME_FOLDER`.

## Blueprint authoring policy (MUST read before BP write ops)

**非必要不写蓝图 Node 和 Graph.** Agent-authored BPs are visibly weaker than C++ on readability/maintainability/perf. Default response to "用蓝图实现 X":

1. State the tradeoff. Bridge has full graph-write primitives but agent-Graphs are weaker than C++.
2. Offer alternative: a C++ `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)` with thin BP wrapper, or another bridge surface (Material / Anim / UMG / DataTable / Level).
3. **Re-confirm explicitly**: "你仍然希望我用蓝图 Node/Graph 实现，还是改走 C++？"
4. Only proceed on explicit insistence ("就用蓝图写"). Otherwise redirect.

**Exceptions** (skip the dance):
- Pure data writes (`set_blueprint_variable_default` etc.) without new nodes
- Bulk automation explicitly framed as such ("扫 100 个 BP 改默认值")
- Standing authorization in `CLAUDE.md` or current conversation

Hard line: any op spawning/connecting/removing nodes, adding events, or creating functions needs the confirmation dance.

## Blueprint review loop (mandatory after BP authoring)

After authoring/modifying a BP graph (and the user confirmed they want it):

```
1. plan        — list events / functions / local vars in text first
2. build       — add_*_node / connect_graph_pins / add_blueprint_variable …
3. auto_layout — MANDATORY after ANY graph mutation; use 'pin_aligned' (3-exec flow) or 'exec_flow' (bulk).
                 See bridge-blueprint-api.md for the exact open→sleep→layout sequence.
4. lint        — lint_blueprint(...) and resolve every warning/error
5. collapse    — collapse_nodes_to_function on any LongExecChain finding
6. straighten  — straighten_exec_chain on main rails (after 'exec_flow' only)
7. comment     — add_comment_box + set_comment_box_color per section (>10 nodes = mandatory)
8. compile     — compile_blueprints clean
```

- **Lint is non-optional.** Fix every warning/error or comment-box-justify it.
- **Name things.** Rename `UnnamedCustomEvent` / `CustomEvent_0` to intent (`OnHealthChanged`).
- **Comment boxes are section titles.** Any graph >10 nodes needs at least one comment box with a meaningful title (`"1. Validate inputs"`, `"2. Apply damage"`) and an appropriate preset color (`Section`, `Validation`, `Danger`, `Network`, `UI`, `Debug`, `Setup`).
- **Pick the right layout strategy.** `auto_layout_graph(... 'pin_aligned' ...)` uses DFS-ordered leaves + downstream-driven Y alignment + live Slate geometry — matches hand-laid BP shape (`.then` rails horizontal, siblings stacked in one column). Requires the three-exec flow (open graph → sleep → layout) to read live widgets. Use `'exec_flow'` (Sugiyama-lite, layer-center Y) for bulk tidy on large graphs where pixel-accuracy matters less, then follow with `straighten_exec_chain` on the main rail.
- **Compact by spacing, not by node.** `pin_aligned` treats `h_spacing` as a loose upper bound and internally uses `DataHSpace = max(15, h/3)` and `ExecGap = max(30, h/2)` — so `h_spacing=100` renders tighter than the raw number suggests. Pass smaller values (`40, 32`) for max density.
- **Size predict before spawning.** If placing several nodes in a row by hand, call `predict_node_size` for each kind first so X offsets don't overlap.
- **Post-layout geometry reads.** After `auto_layout_graph` runs, Slate widgets don't refresh `NodePosX/Y` until they tick — so `get_rendered_node_info` returns *pre-layout* pin coords in the same exec. For crossing-detection / wire-length audits right after layout, read `get_node_layout(bp, fn, guid).pos_*` (authoritative from node model) and estimate pin Y as `pos_y + 40 + 22 × dir_index`. Only pay the open-graph + sleep cost when you specifically need Slate-accurate coords.
- `auto_insert_reroutes` is intentionally NOT in the loop — empirically it produces many-knot routing that reads worse than the original. Opt in per-graph if a specific case needs it.

## Non-ASCII output (CJK / Greek / emoji)

Bridge is UTF-8 byte-perfect end-to-end since 2026-05-04. **Mojibake = display, not data.** Confirm with hex:

```python
print(got.encode('utf-8').hex(), '==', '测试'.encode('utf-8').hex())
```

If hex matches, it's a Windows cp936/cp1252 console issue — fix the *display*, not the bridge:

| Situation | Fix |
|---|---|
| Piping `bridge.py ... > out.txt` writes cp936 | prefix `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` (bash) / `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'` + `\| Out-File -Encoding utf8` (PS) |
| Reading saved file back | `open(p, encoding='utf-8')` (or `utf-8-sig` for PS BOM) |
| Calling bridge.py from another Python process | set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` in subprocess env |

Verified: identifiers + literals in script source, exception messages/tracebacks, DataTable FName keys, asset paths with Chinese folders, save→restart→read persistence. Korean/Japanese use the same UTF-8 path — verify with hex if anything looks off.

**Never write temp files to `C:\` root** — use `$env:TEMP\…` or `/tmp/…`.

## Safety Rules

- **NEVER** delete assets / actors / files without explicit confirmation.
- **NEVER** modify or overwrite assets without describing the change first.
- Wrap state-changing ops in `unreal.ScopedEditorTransaction`.
- On failure: show full traceback. Don't silently retry destructive ops.

## Notes

- Python interpreter is **persistent** — variables carry between `exec` calls.
- `print()` returns to bridge; `unreal.log()` only to UE Output Log.
- Structured data: `import json; print(json.dumps(...))` with `--json`.
- If `ping` fails: editor not running, plugin not enabled, or wrong project (preconditions above).
- Timeout: retry with `--timeout 120`.
