UnrealBridge is an Unreal Engine editor bridging layer built for AI Agents. It provides a typed operation surface for core scenarios such as animation-asset introspection, reactive event subscription, asset search and reference analysis, and automatic layout of Blueprint graphs. The Agent issues queries and modifications against a locally running editor instance; every change takes effect in real time, is bounded by the transaction system, and is undoable.

## Highlights

- **AST-based hallucination defense.** Before any script reaches UE, `bridge_preflight.py` parses it as Python AST and validates every `unreal.UnrealBridge*Library.fn(...)` call against an auto-generated manifest (17 libraries × 869 UFUNCTIONs) — catching unknown function/library names (with did-you-mean), wrong positional arg counts, unknown kwargs, and non-existent bridge-enum members **without ever round-tripping to the editor**. A second layer redirects raw `AssetRegistry` / `GameplayStatics` usage patterns to their bridge equivalents and tracks each returned value's type so attribute access on a `str` or `SoftObjectPath` doesn't silently misbehave; on a real `AttributeError` from a UE object the bridge calls back into UE Python, lists that live class's reflected `UPROPERTY`s, and emits a paste-ready correction (auto-handles `snake_case` ↔ `PascalCase` mismatches). A third layer ships a kwargs-only Python wrapper module so positional-arg-order errors are structurally impossible. Together these dropped a fresh-context agent's bridge-call failure rate from **24% → 16%** across A/B validation runs — protection that prompt-only "look-up-before-call" rules in `SKILL.md` had failed to deliver.

  </p>

- **Deep asset-structure introspection + author-level write ops.** `UnrealBridgeAnimLibrary` covers full queries over AnimBP state machines, AnimGraph nodes, linked layers, slots, curves, Sequence / Montage / BlendSpace, and the skeleton tree — paired with a full suite of write ops: building an ABP from scratch, adding / removing states / transitions / condition rules, creating and wiring AnimGraph nodes, auto-layout of both the state machine and AnimGraph. `UnrealBridgeAssetLibrary` goes beyond keyword search with forward-dependency and reverse-reference analysis, surfacing a complete dependency view to the Agent. Compared with basic CRUD wrappers or schemes that require hand-assembled reflection calls, this level of structured capability is available out of the box.
- **Reactive event subscription.** The Agent can subscribe to GAS events, attribute changes, actor lifecycle, AnimNotify, input, timers, and editor-side asset-change events. When the specified event fires, the bridge calls back proactively — no polling needed. This is a scenario that a pure request / response protocol cannot cover.
- **Agent control surface at PIE runtime.** `UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary` provides aggregated world observation, navigation pathfinding, and input operations for movement / look / jump — suitable for AI-behavior validation, automated testing, and in-game NPC prototyping.
- **Blueprint graph quality toolchain.** More than just auto-layout: `auto_layout_graph`'s `pin_aligned` strategy reads live Slate geometry to align exec rails, `straighten_exec_chain` snaps the main rail, `collapse_nodes_to_function` extracts subgraphs, `lint_blueprint` scans by fixed rules for orphans / unnamed nodes / oversized functions / uncommented large graphs, and `add_comment_box` + preset palette (Section / Validation / Danger / Network / UI / Debug / Setup) partition graphs for readability. AnimGraph and state machines get dedicated `auto_layout_anim_graph` / `auto_layout_state_machine` (the latter recurses into each state's inner graph + every transition rule graph).
- **Native Python execution.** 17 `UnrealBridge*Library` surfaces expose ~870 `UFUNCTION`s in total, covering common subsystems; un-wrapped capabilities are reachable directly through the native `unreal.*` API. Compared to fixed-tool-list MCP schemes or reflection protocols that expose only a single `call` command, this design strikes a balance between flexibility and structure. Every level write op is wrapped in `FScopedTransaction` and supports standard Undo / Redo.

    Server["FUnrealBridgeServer"]
    Libs["UnrealBridge*Library<br/>(17 surfaces, ~870 UFUNCTIONs)"]
    UE["Unreal Editor 5.4+"]

    Agent -- "shell" --> CLI
    CLI -- "UDP probe<br/>239.255.42.99:9876" --> Server
    CLI -- "TCP / JSON<br/>(port from discovery)" --> Server
    Server -- "GameThread<br/>Python dispatch" --> Libs
    Libs --> UE
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/UnrealBridge.git
cd UnrealBridge
```

### 2. Install the plugin

Edit the `DST` line in `sync_plugin.bat` to point at your UE project's `Plugins/` folder:

```bat
set "DST=D:\Path\To\YourProject\Plugins\UnrealBridge"
```

Run `sync_plugin.bat`. It mirrors `Plugin/UnrealBridge/` into the project, skipping `Binaries/` and `Intermediate/`.

### 3. Build & launch

Open the `.uproject` and let UE rebuild the plugin automatically, or run the project's `Build.bat` from the command line. Launch the editor — the plugin starts the server at `PostEngineInit`. You're good once `LogUnrealBridge: Listening on 127.0.0.1:<port>` shows up in the log (the port is OS-assigned; the client finds it via multicast — no manual config needed).

### 4. Verify

```bash
python .claude/skills/unreal-bridge/scripts/bridge.py ping
# → pong
python .claude/skills/unreal-bridge/scripts/bridge.py exec \
  "import unreal; print(unreal.UnrealBridgeLevelLibrary.get_level_summary())"
```

### Claude Code integration (optional)

Copy the skill somewhere Claude Code can discover it:

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/unreal-bridge ~/.claude/skills/            # user-wide
# or into the target project's own .claude/skills/
```

For `rebuild_relaunch.py` to auto-relaunch the editor, set one of:

```bash
setx UNREAL_EDITOR_EXE "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe"
setx UE_ROOT            "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7"
```

### Quick usage

Once the skill is installed, drop any of these into a Claude Code session:

- *"List every PointLight in the current level."*
- *"Move the PlayerStart up by 200 units."*
- *"Compile `/Game/Blueprints/BP_Character` and tell me whether it has errors."*
- *"Show me the state machines inside `/Game/Animations/ABP_Hero`."*
- *"Create an ABP on `SK_Mannequin` with an Idle / Walk / Run state machine driven by a `Speed` variable (>10 enters Walk, >200 enters Run), then layer a Slot + LayeredBoneBlend in the outer graph for an upper-body overlay."*

The Agent reads `SKILL.md`, picks the right `UnrealBridge*Library` function, calls it through `bridge.py`, and reports back.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
bridge.py ping
bridge.py exec "print('hello from UE')"
bridge.py exec-file my_script.py
```

Flags (all optional — the common case works with no flags):

- `--project=<name|path>` — disambiguate when >1 editors are running
- `--endpoint=host:port` — skip discovery, connect directly (also env `UNREAL_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT`)
- `--token=<secret>` — only when the server binds non-loopback (also env `UNREAL_BRIDGE_TOKEN`)
- `--timeout` (default 30s), `--json`, `--discovery-timeout=<ms>` (default 800)

`bridge.py list-editors` sends a probe and lists every editor that answered — handy for multi-editor setups.

### From Python inside UE

```python
import unreal

summary = unreal.UnrealBridgeLevelLibrary.get_level_summary()
print(summary)

lights = unreal.UnrealBridgeLevelLibrary.find_actors_by_class(
    "/Script/Engine.PointLight", 50
)
print(len(lights), "point lights")
```

### Two reload loops

```bash
python .claude/skills/unreal-bridge/scripts/hot_reload.py        # body-only edits
python .claude/skills/unreal-bridge/scripts/rebuild_relaunch.py  # reflection changes
```

## Bridge libraries

Source enumeration via `list_tag_source_inis`; redirect ledger via `list_gameplay_tag_redirects` + `remove_gameplay_tag_redirect` for enumerate-then-sweep cleanup |
| `UnrealBridgePerfLibrary` | Structured perf snapshots: frame timing (FPS / GT / RT / GPU / RHI ms, stat-unit and raw modes), render counters (draw calls / primitives, summed across GPUs), process memory, `TObjectIterator` class histogram, ISO-8601 timestamped aggregate snapshot. USTRUCT output — no `stat unit` text parsing |
| `UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary` | PIE-runtime Agent control: aggregated world observation, navigation pathfinding; movement / look / jump / teleport / sticky input, Enhanced Input and MappingContext; pawn velocity, ability, jump-arc simulation; camera ray, screen ↔ world, NavMesh projection; damage, physics impulse, time dilation, sound, camera shake; debug draw; AI-controller probing |
| `UnrealBridgeNavigationLibrary` | Export NavMesh as OBJ for external visualization and geometry analysis |
| `UnrealBridgeReactive*` | Event subscription framework with 10 adapters: runtime (GameplayEvent, AttributeChanged, ActorLifecycle, MovementMode, AnimNotify, InputAction, Timer) and editor (AssetEvent, PieState, BpCompiled); handler register / list / pause / resume / stats; cross-session JSON persistence. Replaces polling |

## Protocol

Two channels:

1. **UDP multicast discovery** on `239.255.42.99:9876`. Client broadcasts a `probe` with a request id and an optional project filter; every running editor replies with its bound TCP address + port + token fingerprint. Multiple editors coexist on the same host via `SO_REUSEADDR`.

2. **TCP data** on the port the editor reports in its discovery response (OS-assigned; `127.0.0.1` by default). Length-prefixed JSON:

```
Request :  [4-byte big-endian length][{"id","script","timeout","token?"}]
Response:  [4-byte big-endian length][{"id","success","output","error"}]
Ping    :  {"id","command":"ping"}  →  pong
```

Token auth kicks in automatically when the server binds non-loopback; the client reads the token from `<Project>/Saved/UnrealBridge/token.txt` and includes it in every request.

Scripts run on the GameThread; captured stdout and stderr are separated by the special `__UB_ERR__` sentinel.

### Server config (CLI / env / `EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini [UnrealBridge]`)

| CLI | Env | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-UnrealBridgeBind=` | `UNREAL_BRIDGE_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `-UnrealBridgePort=` | `UNREAL_BRIDGE_PORT` | `0` (OS-assigned) |
| `-UnrealBridgeToken=` | `UNREAL_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | empty (required when bind ≠ loopback) |
| `-UnrealBridgeDiscoveryGroup=` | `UNREAL_BRIDGE_DISCOVERY_GROUP` | `239.255.42.99:9876` |
| `-UnrealBridgeNoDiscovery` *(flag)* | `UNREAL_BRIDGE_DISCOVERY=0` | discovery on |

## Requirements

- **Unreal Engine 5.4+** with `PythonScriptPlugin` and `GameplayAbilities` (both ship with the engine). The matrix at `tools/build_matrix.py` verifies builds against 5.4 and 5.7; some libraries (Chooser / PoseSearch / Material / Navigation + a few standalone UFUNCTIONs) require 5.7+ — see [docs/version-compatibility.md](docs/version-compatibility.md)
- **Windows 10/11** — the plugin itself is portable, but paths inside the helper scripts are hard-coded Windows-style
- **Python 3.9+** on PATH
- **Visual Studio 2022** with the UE workload — for plugin compilation
- **Claude Code CLI** — optional, only if you use the bundled skill

## Safety

- Every level-edit op is wrapped in `FScopedTransaction` — Ctrl+Z in the editor reverts anything the bridge did.
- The TCP server binds to `127.0.0.1` only; it is not reachable from the network.
